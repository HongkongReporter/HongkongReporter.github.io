<h3><i>Gauge Theory and 3+1 Dimensional Topology</i></h3>
<p>Here are the notes from previous summer that I kept, and some for the Topology/Floer Theory seminar.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Miscellaneous notes concerning applications of \( L^2 \) method or De-Giorgi estimates to elliptic/d-bar Problems. These are part of the summer DRP done way back when I was in UCLA, directed by Prof. Garnett and Prof. Manolescu. [ <A HREF="d-bar.pdf">1</a> | <A HREF="251B.pdf">2</a> ]</li>
  [1] discusses Hormander's approach to d-bar problem, by estimating(in fact expressing explicitly) the dual operator in Cauchy-Riemann complex. [2] follows the note, discussing the elliptic regulairty by means of estimating the boundary.

<h3><i>Experiment Logs About Parallelisms, Softwares & Others</i></h3>
<p> This section records some of my softwares projects update and algorithm experiments log.
<ul>
  <li> Parallelism implementation of top-down dynamical programming. This project exploits the lock-free shared hashtable to produce a effective algorithm in the multi-core setting where the knapsack needed to parallel is implemented in a top-down fashion; this method is suggusted by [<A HREF="stivala2010.pdf"> Stuckey </a>].</li>
