<p>Here are the notes from previous summer that I kept, and some for the Topology/Floer Theory seminar.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Miscellaneous notes concerning applications of L^2 method or De-Giorgi estimates to elliptic/d-bar Problems. [<A HREF="d-bar.pdf">1</a>|<A HREF="251B.pdf">2</a>]</li>
  [1] discusses Hormander's approach to d-bar problem, by estimating(in fact expressing explicitly) the dual operator in Cauchy-Riemann complex. [2] follows the note, discussing the elliptic regulairty by means of estimating the boundary.
